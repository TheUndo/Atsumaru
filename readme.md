## Atsumaru is no longer open source

I created Atsumaru back in 2022 (it's 2025 as of writing this) with the goal of creating an awesome site that the users could use and contribute to. The users came but unfortunetely nobody wanted to contribute. Most people with a few exceptions only wanted to get instructions on how to deploy a for-profit version of the site. This was upsetting to say the least but I suppose that's the way things work in this industry.

And that's why I'm closing the code, it did more harm than good to have it open.

## Will the Atsumaru 2.0 be open source?

After creating Atsumaru 2.0, a greatly improved and fully self hosted version I decided not to open source it. If enough people want to make actual contributions to the code then I may consider opening it again especially now that the infra is much more complex and expensive to operate (checkmate cheapskates).

Unfortunetely open sourcing is unlikely. Atsumaru will continue to be ad-free and great just not open sourced.

Old Atsumaru 1.0 code is on the [`dev`](https://github.com/TheUndo/Atsumaru/tree/dev) branch.

Best,
